    "1. Completely define **Model** and **Apply** Phases with basics within the Metrics Phase\n",
    "1. Support for major machine learning tasks:\n",
    "    - Classification - SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Rergession, K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    - Regression - Simple Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net\n",
    "    - Clustering - K-Means\n",
