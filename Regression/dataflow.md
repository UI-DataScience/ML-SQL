# Regression Dataflow



## Datasets used

1. Auto-mpg data set (



## Assumptions

I will assume we start with a datafile (ex. already have the .csv, .txt, .data, etc.) downloaded locally on our computer. From here our language will be able to perform machine learning tasks on these datasets.



## General Steps and Tasks



##Considerations

We notice that there are some machine learning tasks that may deviate from the steps we may have generalized. These tasks may be implemented in the future as the ML-SQL develops.

- Missing data or NA's
